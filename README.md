# Assignment 4: Group Project OOP design principles

### Brainstorm

Program will be an Ice Cream Shop.

### Requirements

* A list : list of orders
* A map : table # to orders (decided was bad) or item/decorator to price
* Enums : size or sugar free, fat free, etc.
* Exception handling: Reading in from file all menu items + types.

### Classes

'View'
* InputHelper

'Model'
* FileReader
* Enums -> size, containers (cone vs cup, etc)

'Controllers'
* IceCreamShop
* Order
* PurchasableItems -> snow cone, sundae, ice cream




### Design Paterns

We could use MVC easily and Singleton design pattern for InputHelper.
